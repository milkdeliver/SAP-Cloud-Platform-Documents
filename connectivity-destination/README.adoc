= Integration with Connectivity and Destination

== Preparation

You need to prepare below before you start the Integration.

* Account to login to SAP Cloud Platform
* Access to github.wdf
* Access to download the Cloud Collector from https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud[Download Cloud Collector for Windowns]
* Internet access to download Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 runtime libraries (vcredist_x64.exe) from link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784[Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013]
* Java 8 download and installation
* SAP JVM download from https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud[Download SAP JVM]
* SAP Cloud Collector download from https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud[SAP Development Tools for Eclipse (portable variant)]

== Installation of prepared components (Follow below sequence)

* Installation for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 runtime libraries 
* Java 8 installation
* Installation for SAP JVM from link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/76137f42711e1014839a8273b0e91070.html[SAP JVM Installation]

NOTE: The SAP JVM only includes JDK files, you can choose to use it or not depends on your situation.


=== Installation of Cloud Connector

Here the *_portable_* version was chosed as the installed version. You only need to download it and extract it as a directory in your local system.

=== Start the Cloud Connector

. Go to the root directory of your cloud connector
. Open your browser and go to your https://localhost:8443[localhost]

Once you login to your local host in your browser, your Cloud Connector output window prompts messages as below:

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/cloud-connector-command-window.png[Cloud Connector Command Window]

NOTE: The *_localhost_* in the url can be replaced with the *_host name_* of your local.
Once you login into the Cloud Connector, you might need to change you password.
The default login username/password is *_Administrator/manage_*.




== Configuration of Cloud Connector

=== Prerequisites

* The subaccount user that you use for initial setup must be a member of the global account that the subaccount belongs to
* In the Neo environment, the subaccount user that you use for initial setup must be assigned to the Cloud Connector Admin or Administrator role

=== Manage Subaccount

NOTE: The Region should be *_cf.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn_*.
The *_Subaccount_* should be got from your subaccount information in SAP Cloud Foundry cockpit and should be the UUID format.
The *_username_* should be your username login to the SAP Cloud Foundry, usually it should be email address.
The *_password_* should be the password of your login username.

After you complete the subaccount configuration you shall see below page:

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/subaccount-dashboard.png[Subaccount Dashboard]

NOTE: You can find the related log in your local directory *_..\sapcc-2.12.2-windows-x64\log_*


=== Configure Access Control

Specify the backend systems that can be accessed by your cloud applications.
To allow your cloud applications to access a certain backend system on the intranet, you must specify this system in the Cloud Connector. The procedure is specific to the protocol that you are using for communication.

NOTE: Here only choose Configure Access Control (HTTP) for example, if your scenario is different you can go to link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/f42fe4471d6a4a5fb09b7f3bb83c66a4.html[Configure Access Control] for more detail.

==== Configure Access Control (HTTP)

Specify the backend systems that can be accessed by your cloud applications using HTTP.
To allow your cloud applications to access a certain backend system on the intranet via HTTP, you must specify this system in the Cloud Connector.

. Choose Cloud To On Premise from your Subaccount menu.
. Choose Add. A wizard will open and ask for the required values.
. Backend Type: Select the description that matches best the addressed backend system.

NOTE: Here only choose *_Non-SAP System_* as the example. The *_protocol_* uses *_HTTPS_*.
The *_Internet Host_* uses *_github.wdf.sap.corp_*. The *_Internet Port_* uses *_443_*.
The *_Virtual Host_* and *_Virtual Port_* values automatically input as the same value with Internet Host and Internet Port.
The *_Principal Type_* keeps its default value.


[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
|Configuration Option
|Value

|protocol
|HTTPS

|Internet Host
|github.wdf.sap.corp

|Internet Port
|443

|Virtual Host
|github.wdf.sap.corp

|Virtual Port
|443

|Principal Type
|None

|Host In Request Header
|Use Virtual Host

|===



NOTE: The option value set as *_Use Internal Host_* when the out proxy connects.

You can click below button to check the host is reachable or not:

==== Limit the Accessible Services for HTTP(S)

By limiting the acessible service for HTTPS, you need to specify which URL paths(*_Resources_*) are allowed to be invoked on the *_host_* you configured in above section.
The Cloud Connector uses very strict white-lists for its access control, so only those URLs for which you explicitly granted access are allowed. 
All other HTTP(S) requests are denied by the Cloud Connector.

NOTE: Add multiple paths according to your situation.

== Using Service 

=== Create Connectivity Service

Go to service marketplace and create a new Connectivity service.

=== Create Desitnation Service

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/create-destination-service.png[Create Destination Service Instance Key]


=== Create Desitnation Service Key

Record below attributes to use in the next few steps:

[cols=1*,options=header]
|===
|Attributes in Service Key credentials

|clientid

|clientsecret

|url

|uri

|===

=== Get access token for the destination service

Type link:https://destination-configuration.cfapps.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn/destination-configuration/v1/instanceDestination[URL] to try to get the access token.

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/get-access-token.png[Get Access Token]

A sub window prompts for detail attributes input.

Please follow below to input parameters in Postman:

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
|Parameter
|Desscription

|Token Name
|Input any value as you wish

|Access Token URL
|Use *_url_* in the service key credentials

|Client ID
|Use *_clientid_* in the service key credentials

|Client Secret
|Use *_clientsecret_* in the service key credentials

|Grant Type
|Select *_Client Credentials_*


|===

NOTE: You need to manually add *_/oauth/token_* behind of the *_Access Token URL_*.
After you click the *_Request Token_* the acess token window will disappear and return back to the main page of Postman.
You will see the token you operated displayed in the token list.

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/get-access-token-3.png[Get Access Token 3]

Clieck *_Use Token_* to add the token into the request header.

image::https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sap-samples-scpcn/delivery-center/blob/dev/ZResources/get-access-token-4.png[Get Access Token 4]

You will see the token you requested was added into the request header.

=== Request to set the new destination

Reuse the request in the above, just change the Request type to *_POST_*.

Use below as the request body content as *_JSON_* format:

.Request Body as JSON format
----
{
	"Name": "application-studio-test",
	"Type": "HTTP",
	"URL": "http://github.wdf.sap.corp:443",
	"ProxyType": "OnPremise",
	"PropertyName": "application-studio-test",
	"Description": "This is the demo for the connectivity and destination",
	"TruestAll": "true",
    "Authentication": "NoAuthentication",
	"WebIDEEnabled": "true"
}
----

Set the request URL as https://destination-configuration.cfapps.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn/destination-configuration/v1/subaccountDestinations

You will see the return code is 201:

=== Request to get the new added destination

Set the request URL as https://destination-configuration.cfapps.cn40.platform.sapcloud.cn/destination-configuration/v1/subaccountDestinations
Use the *_Get_* method and reuse the access token in the above.

You will find the new added destination from the response.
